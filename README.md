Yulu, India's pioneering micro-mobility service provider, has embarked on a mission to revolutionize daily commutes by offering unique, sustainable transportation solutions.
This case study analyzes how different seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and working vs. non-working days affect the Yulu bike rides. 
It also employs various hypothesis testing methods to determine whether the results are significant or due to chance.

Steps performed: 

Conducted data exploration to understand the dataset.
Cleaned the data by handling missing and null values.
Outlier Detection and Treatment:

Identified outliers in the dataset and addressed them appropriately.
Establishing Relationships Between Variables:

Defined the dependent variable (number of bike rides/bookings) and independent variables (seasons, weather conditions, holidays, weekdays vs. weekends).
Analyzed correlations between the independent variables and bike bookings.
Correlation Analysis:

Investigated the correlation between weekends and bike bookings.
Significant Differences Analysis:

Checked for significant differences in bike rides across different variables.
Assumption Checks for Statistical Tests:

Normality Assessment:
Used histogram plots and Q-Q plots to visually assess normality.
Conducted Shapiro-Wilk’s test to statistically evaluate normality.
Statistical Tests for Distribution:
Calculated skewness and kurtosis to analyze the distribution characteristics.
Equality of Variance:
Performed Levene’s test to check for equality of variances between groups.
Inferences and Conclusions:

Summarized findings from the analysis, including insights from hypothesis testing and assumption checks.
