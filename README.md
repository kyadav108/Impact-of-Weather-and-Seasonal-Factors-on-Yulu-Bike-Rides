# Welcome to My Project! ðŸš€

Yulu, India's pioneering micro-mobility service provider, has embarked on a mission to revolutionize daily commutes by offering unique, sustainable transportation solutions.
This case study analyzes how different seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and working vs. non-working days affect the Yulu bike rides. 
It also employs various hypothesis testing methods to determine whether the results are significant or due to chance.

**Steps performed:**
* Conducted data exploration to understand the dataset.
* Cleaned the data by handling missing and null values.

* Outlier Detection and Treatment:Identified outliers in the dataset and addressed them appropriately.
  
Establishing Relationships Between Variables:

* Defined the dependent variable (number of bike rides/bookings) and independent variables (seasons, weather conditions, holidays, weekdays vs. weekends).
* Analyzed correlations between the independent variables and bike bookings.
  
Correlation Analysis:

* Investigated the correlation between weekends and bike bookings.

Significant Differences Analysis:
* Checked for significant differences in bike rides across different variables.

Assumption Checks for Statistical Tests:
* Normality Assessment:
    * Used histogram plots and Q-Q plots to visually assess normality.
    * Conducted Shapiro-Wilkâ€™s test to statistically evaluate normality.
    
Statistical Tests for Distribution:
* Calculated skewness and kurtosis to analyze the distribution characteristics.
  
Equality of Variance:
* Performed Leveneâ€™s test to check for equality of variances between groups.

Inferences and Conclusions:
Summarized findings from the analysis, including insights from hypothesis testing and assumption checks.

## Observations and Insights:
**Weather Patterns:**

Dominance of Weather 1: Across all seasons, weather type 1 (mostly clear) is the most prevalent.
Season 1 (Spring): Weather 1 at 16.8%, Weather 2 at 7.2%, Weather 3 at 2%. Weather 4 had a negligible presence (0.01%).
Season 2: Weather 1 at 15.5%, Weather 2 at 6.5%, Weather 3 at 2.2%.
Season 3: Weather 1 at 16.8%, Weather 2 at 5.4%, Weather 3 at 1.8%.
Season 4: Weather 1 at 15.9%, Weather 2 at 8%, Weather 3 at 2.2%.

**Insights**
Holiday vs. Working Days:

Bike Usage Patterns: 97.22% of rides occur on non-holidays, indicating higher usage on weekdays. Holidays account for only 2.77% of total rides.
Seasonal Trends:

Season 3: Highest bike rides at 30.7%, followed by Season 2 at 28.2%. Seasons 1 and 4 have lower percentages (26.1% and 15%, respectively).
Weather Conditions:

Predominant Weather: Weather type 1 (Mostly Clear) constitutes 70.8% of rides. Weather type 2 follows at 24.3%, and type 3 at 4.9%. Weather type 4 has 0% usage.
Temperature Influence:

Correlation with Casual Riders: A stronger positive correlation (0.53) with temperature for casual riders compared to registered riders (0.29), indicating that casual riders are more influenced by temperature changes.
Wind Speed and Humidity:

Minimal Impact: Weak positive correlation (0.13) for wind speed on both rider types.
Negative Humidity Correlation: Humidity negatively affects ridership for both casual (-0.33) and registered riders (-0.30).
Recommendations
Optimize Operations for Workdays: Focus business planning around working days and non-holidays, as these periods account for most rides. Plan inventory, supply chain, and customer service enhancements to improve the experience and profitability during peak times.

Promote During Holidays: Use targeted advertising and discounts on holidays and weekends to increase ridership during these lower-volume days.

Leverage Weather Data: Since 71% of rides occur on clear days, utilize weather forecasts for inventory and pricing strategies. Implement variable pricing based on weather conditions, offering surcharges on clear days and discounts during inclement weather.

Engage Casual Riders: With the correlation between temperature and casual riders, focus on converting them to registered users during optimal seasons. Promote registration incentives during warmer weather.

Address Humidity Effects: Offer discounts or promotions during high humidity periods to encourage ridership, as both rider types show decreased usage in such conditions.

Monitor Weather Trends: Continuously monitor weather patterns and adjust business strategies accordingly. Use weather-related advertising and provide app-based notifications for discounts on low business days to enhance engagement and ridership.
